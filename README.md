AI Literature Review Assistant (RAG-Based)

Overview
This project builds a Generative AI application in Dify to help graduate students summarize and compare academic research papers.

Core Approach
We use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant document chunks and generate grounded summaries tied to uploaded PDFs.

Phase 1
- Upload 3–5 PDFs
- Set up Dify knowledge base
- Create structured summary prompt
- Test comparison query
